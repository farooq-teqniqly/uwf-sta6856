## Problem 7a


```{r}
phi <- c(0.4)
theta <- c(0.6)
n <- 70

theoretical_acf <- ARMAacf(ar = phi,
                           ma = theta,
                           lag.max = 20)
plot(
  theoretical_acf,
  type = "h",
  main = "Theoretical ACF",
  xlab = "Lag",
  ylab = "ACF"
)
abline(h = 0)
```
## Problem 7b
```{r}
set.seed(123)

series <- arima.sim(
  n = n, 
  model = list(ar = phi, ma = theta))

acf(series, main = "Sample ACF")

```

The sample ACF closely resembles the theoretical ACF in shape. The overall pattern of slow decay after significant values in lags 1 and 2 shows up in both plots.

## Problem 7c
```{r}
library(TSA)
eacf(series)
```
