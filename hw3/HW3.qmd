## Problem 5a


```{r}
phi <- c(0.7, -0.4)

theoretical_acf <- ARMAacf(ar = phi, ma = numeric(0), lag.max = 20)
plot(theoretical_acf, type = "h", main = "Theoretical ACF", xlab = "lag", ylab = "ACF")
abline(h = 0)
```
## Problem 5b
```{r}
set.seed(123)

phi <- c(0.7, -0.4)
n <- 72
ar2_series <- arima.sim(n = n, model = list(ar = phi))

acf(ar2_series, main = "Sample ACF")

```

The sample ACF closely resembles the theoretical ACF in shape and sign. The overall pattern of slow decay shows up in both plots.
